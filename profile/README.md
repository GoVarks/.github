<h1 align="center">Official GoVarks.com Organization</h1>

This is the official GitHub Organization for the GoVarks.com website, which provides live scores, headlines, athlete profiles, and more for OES Athletics. GoVarks.com is not an official website and is run by students at the school.

## About the repositories
At the moment, there is only one repository (GoVarks/GoVarks) and it is private. However, there are more repositories coming in the future, many of which will be open-source and available for public contribution.
